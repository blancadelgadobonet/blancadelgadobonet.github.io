Growing up, I have been gradually discovering my passion: biomedical signals and neurology. I was first attracted by the interdisciplinarity of biomedical engineering. I enrolled the bachelor’s degree and acquired a basis in life, physical and computer sciences. Seeking to apply the concepts I was learning, I joined the [Medical Image Analysis and Biometry Laboratory](https://laimbio.org). The first year I was captivated by the potential of medical images. Then, supported by a student collaboration scholarship, I was able to develop my bachelor thesis in collaboration with the Hospital Ramón y Cajal (i.e., Differential diagnosis of parkinsonisms: a selection of radiomic features). Reading about Parkinson’s Disease and learning from the Neuroradiologist who guided my thesis, I became fascinated about the brain and its pathologies. Currently, I am broadening my knowledge in imaging and artificial intelligence (AI) through a master’s degree in computer vision, and I continue to guide my career towards neuroimaging; my master thesis will evaluate brain age in pediatric patients with chronic pain at the Hospital 12 Octubre. 

While following my classes, I have proven interest in extracurricular activities (including courses, Open Houses and Symposiums). I enjoyed a summer internship at the [Dept. Information Engineering of the University of Padova](https://www.dei.unipd.it/home-page), where I researched the fusion of electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) signals and grew curiosity in multimodality and explainable AI. I have also teamed up with a veterinary doctor – my brother – in a collaboration between our two laboratories (i.e., “Combination immunotherapies for canine gliomas and application of radiomics in the detection of predictive biomarkers”). Finally, I have had the extraordinary opportunity to join the [Neural Rehabilitation Group](https://www.neuralrehabilitation.org/en/), thanks to a JAE Intro scholarship.

In the upcoming years, I would like to continue learning about electrophysiology and medical imaging. I wish to one day master these techniques and employ them to better understand the functioning of the brain and its degeneration. The potential of the brain is well acknowledged by the society in general, and its operation has inspired state-of-the-art techniques such as deep learning. But I believe there is still so much more to discover.
