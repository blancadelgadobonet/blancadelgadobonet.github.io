Let me introduce you to one of the subjects of the Official Master in Computer Vision: **ROBOTIC VISION**. For this course, we will learn by doing. In addition to delivering several practices, we will have to document our progress in a blog (e.g., just like this blog!).

Now you can guess the first task: CREATING A BLOG.

Among the many options, one can choose to create a webpage with GitHub. Because GitHub is a very popular platform to share code and work with other computer vision developers, I find specially useful to get comfortable around it. In this post, I will tell you how I created my own website.

## Mon 13, March 2023 - Create your own website with GitHub

First, follow this video to find out how to create a genera website using GitHub. Despite being a bit outdated, the tutorial is clear enough to be followed for posterior GitHub versions.

In short, you have to create a **public** repository with the specific name "<account name>.github.io" (e.g., blancadelgadobonet.github.io). Note that this will be your domain to access the website, that is, you will be able to access the website once it is set up by searching "https://<account name>.github.io". Do not create a custom domain (Settings > Pages > Custom Domain) unless you have paid for one. If you choose a custom domain, you might be redirected to a "buy the domain" page; if you delete the custom domain and try to acccess to your previous domain, you will continue to be redirected to the "buy the domain" page. In this case, [erase the cache of your browser](https://oit.colorado.edu/tutorial/clear-web-browser-cache-safari) to recover your website domain.

Then, the "Build and deployment" will need to be configured, but don't do that yet. Follow the next video to check the [al-folio template](https://alshedivat.github.io/al-folio/) for your website. Do not install anything on your computer! After watching, if you are convinced by the template, you can fork the [GitHub repository of the template](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) and follow the installation guide available in the README.md file. The "Build and deployment" will be managed by a bot.
