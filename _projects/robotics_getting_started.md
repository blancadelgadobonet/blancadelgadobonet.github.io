Let me introduce you to one of the subjects of the Official Master in Computer Vision: **ROBOTIC VISION**. For this course, we will learn by doing. In addition to delivering several practices, we will have to document our progress in a blog (e.g., just like this blog!).

Now you can guess the first task: CREATING A BLOG.

Among the many options, one can choose to create a webpage with GitHub. Because GitHub is a very popular platform to share code and work with other computer vision developers, I find specially useful to get comfortable around it. In this post, I will tell you how I created my own website.
