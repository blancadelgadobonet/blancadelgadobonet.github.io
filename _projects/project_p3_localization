This projects consists on programming a robot (i.e., a formula 1 car) to follow the road line in order to complete a circuit. The robot is expected to follow the line as perfectly as possible, that is, 1) without vibrating and 2) without short-cutting! Additionally, the robot should complete the circuits in the least time possible.
